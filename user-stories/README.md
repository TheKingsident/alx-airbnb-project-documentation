# User Stories Documentation

This document outlines the key user stories for the ALX Airbnb project. These stories describe the main functionalities and user interactions with the platform, ensuring a user-centric design and development approach.

## Key User Stories

### 1. **User Registration and Login**
- **As a new user,**  
  I want to register using my email or a third-party provider (like Google),  
  So that I can create an account and access the platform as a guest or host.

### 2. **Listing a Property**
- **As a host,**  
  I want to create and manage property listings with details such as title, description, price, and availability,  
  So that potential guests can view and book my properties.

### 3. **Searching and Booking Properties**
- **As a guest,**  
  I want to search for available properties using filters (location, price, number of guests, etc.),  
  So that I can find a suitable place to stay and make a booking.

### 4. **Making a Payment**
- **As a guest,**  
  I want to securely pay for my booking using a payment gateway (like Stripe or PayPal),  
  So that my reservation is confirmed and the host gets paid after the stay is complete.

### 5. **Leaving Reviews**
- **As a guest,**  
  I want to leave a review and rating after completing a stay,  
  So that I can share my experience with future users and give feedback to the host.

## Purpose
These user stories serve as a foundation for designing and implementing the platform's features, ensuring that the needs of both guests and hosts are met effectively.
