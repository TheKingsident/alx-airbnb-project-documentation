## 1. User Registration and Login
**As a new user,**  
I want to register using my email or a third-party provider (like Google),  
So that I can create an account and access the platform as a guest or host.

## 2. Listing a Property
**As a host,**  
I want to create and manage property listings with details such as title, description, price, and availability,  
So that potential guests can view and book my properties.

## 3. Searching and Booking Properties
**As a guest,**  
I want to search for available properties using filters (location, price, number of guests, etc.),  
So that I can find a suitable place to stay and make a booking.

## 4. Making a Payment
**As a guest,**  
I want to securely pay for my booking using a payment gateway (like Stripe or PayPal),  
So that my reservation is confirmed and the host gets paid after the stay is complete.

## 5. Leaving Reviews
**As a guest,**  
I want to leave a review and rating after completing a stay,  
So that I can share my experience with future users and give feedback to the host.
